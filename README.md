### 👋 Hey, I'm Vibey

A curious builder exploring the intersection of **AI** and **investing**.

🔭 Currently diving deep into:
- LLMs & agent frameworks
- Quantitative analysis — I built [13F Insight](https://13finsight.com) to track hedge fund holdings
- Building tools that scratch my own itch

💡 I believe the best way to learn is to ship. Most of my projects start as "I wonder if..." and end up as something I actually use daily.

📚 When I'm not coding, you'll find me reading SEC filings or arguing about market efficiency on Twitter.
